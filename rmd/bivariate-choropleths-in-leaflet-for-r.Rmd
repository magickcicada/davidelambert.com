A few months back, [Timo Grossenbacher's excellent post](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/) about creating bivariate choropleths using ggplot2 made the rounds in [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) Twitter and elsewhere. That post, as well as his colleague [Angelo Zehr's article](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/interaktive-karte-so-ungleich-ist-das-einkommen-in-der-schweiz-verteilt) with an interactive version, inspired me to create an interactive bivariate choropleth using [RStudio's frontend](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/).

This example explores the relationship between income and income inequality, just as in Grossenbacher's and Zehr's work, but slightly reformats the examination for an American context. First, we'll look at the relationship of inequality to two different common measures of income in the US: median household income and median personal earnings. Second, we'll use use different definitions of low, middle, and high income. Rather than terciles (1/3-quantiles, 33.3% each), we'll use the [Pew Research Center's definition of the middle class](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/11/americas-shrinking-middle-class-a-close-look-at-changes-within-metropolitan-areas/), ranging from 67% -  200% of the median income. As a mesaure of income inequality, we'll look at the [Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) for each tract, where 0 represents perfect income equality, and 1 represents a single household/person receiving all income (perfect inequality).

As an example, we'll map census tracts in [Alameda County, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California). Alameda County is socioeconomically diverse and exhibits a wide range of income/inequality relationships across its 361 census tracts. Alameda County census tracts exhibited the following summary statistics over the 2013-2017 period:
```{r table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)

tabvars <- c("hhinc", "pearn", "gini")

mins <- lapply(st_drop_geometry(alameda[, tabvars]), 
               function(x) min(x, na.rm = TRUE))

maxes <- lapply(st_drop_geometry(alameda[, tabvars]), 
               function(x) max(x, na.rm = TRUE))

means <- lapply(st_drop_geometry(alameda[, tabvars]), 
               function(x) mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))

tab <- bind_rows(mins, maxes, means) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  mutate(
    hhinc = paste0("$", prettyNum(round(hhinc, 0), big.mark = ",")),
    pearn = paste0("$", prettyNum(round(pearn, 0), big.mark = ",")),
    gini = round(gini, 3)
  ) %>% 
  `rownames<-`(c("Minimum", "Maximum", "Mean")) %>%

                 "Median Personal Earnings",
                 "Gini Coefficient"))

## Import Packages

We'll need several additonal packages to get our map fully operational but some that we'll use here are optional. Of the packages below, `tidycensus` is used for data gathering, `dplyr` and `magrittr` are used for preference in data wrangling, and `sf` may or may not be necessary depending on your data's geographic features. The others are strictly necessary.

```{r import, eval=FALSE}
library(tidycensus)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(htmltools)
```




## Collect Data & Geography

We can use Kyle Walker's `tidycensus` package ([GitHub](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) | [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidycensus/index.html)) to gather tract-level summary statistics from the 2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates (covering 2013-2017). `tidycensus` is especially handy because we can get geographic data at the same time and return an `sf`-class data frame. After a little manipulation of columns and names, we'll also want to tweak the map projection to Leaflet's default WGS84 datum (not strictly necessary, but it avoids an annoying warning message).


```{r data pull, results='hide', message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Named vector of ACS tables to get from Census API
varlist <- c("hhinc" = "B19013_001",
             "pearn" = "B20002_001",
             "gini" = "B19083_001")

# tract-level summary data from Census API
alameda <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  state = "CA",
  county = "Alameda",
  variables = varlist,
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2017,
  output = "wide",
  geometry = TRUE
)

# drop margins of error
alameda <- alameda[, c(1, 2, seq(3, 9, by = 2))]

# lowercasse names with no "E" suffix
colnames(alameda) <- c("GEOID", "name", names(varlist), "geometry")

# re-project to play nice with leaflet
alameda <- st_transform(alameda, 4326, type = "datum")

# probably a good idea to save the object in case the API goes down.
save(alameda, file = "alameda_income.Rdata")
```





## Bivariate Color Scale

Constructing a bivariate color scale that's (comparatively) easy for the viewer to understand and interpret can be a challenge. See [Joshua Stevens's 2015 post](http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/), as well as [Grossenbacher's post](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/), for a rundown of the creating bivariate scales and some of the challenges invloved. Luckily, Stevens includes several options in his post, and Christopher Prener has developed the `biscale` package ([GitHub](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/biscale) | [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/biscale/index.html)) to generate bivariate color scales and ggplot legends.

For our purposes, we need to take a different approach. To orient ourselves when zooming in, we'll want to see street names and so forth on the base map. So we'll want transparency in our bivariate color scale, which will require transparency in each of two intersecting univariate scales, each of which is mapped to quantile bins of our income or inequality variables. Ultimately, we'll need full-opacity color values for each region in each univariate scale, plus the resulting values for each region when the univariate scales are intersected at reduced opacity.

To that end, I created basic bivariate scale templates in Illustrator and Inkscape, which are downloadable below. Using Symbols in Illustrator, or Clones in Inkscape, we can tweak each univariate scale independently and automatically view the resulting full-color and reduced-opacity bivariate scales. We can then eyedropper the various cells to get the hex-color values we'll need for the steps below. These templates are available below and dedicated into the public domain under [CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For our example, we'll use the pink/blue/purple scales already in these templates.

## Scale Breaks & Palettes

Once we have developed our bivariate color scale, we need to map our income and inequality variables to color values. To so so, we'll bin our income variables into "Low," "Middle," and "High" categories and map these to the pink/red univariate scale from our template. Then we'll do the same for our Gini coefficient/inequality variable using the cyan/blue univariate scale. When we overlay these scales at 50% opacity using Leaflet, each census tract will get one of the 9 values from the bivariate scale.

As mentioned above, we're going to use the [Pew Research Center's definition of the middle class](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/11/americas-shrinking-middle-class-a-close-look-at-changes-within-metropolitan-areas/) to define the income variable breaks, which we'll call "Pew breaks." The first Pew break, between low and middle income, falls at 67% of _overall_ median income, while the second Pew break falls at 200% of overall median income. To define "overall," we'll again use `tidycensus` to get median income values for the entire [San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward Metropolitan Statistical Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco%E2%80%93Oakland%E2%80%93Berkeley,_CA_Metropolitan_Statistical_Area), which includes Alameda County, San Francisco, and surrounding counties in the immediate SF/Oakland commuting zone. I believe that calculating Pew breaks from the _metro_ area medians will give us better regional context for income than would the Alameda County medians alone.

We'll start with household income. We'll get the metro area median from the Census API and calculate the Pew breaks. We can then use the breaks to define a palette using R-Leaflet's `colorBin()` function. To get our colors' hex values, we'll simply eyedropper the cells in our template's red univariate scale. Then we'll do the same for median personal earnings, also using the red scale hex values.

```{r income palettes, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# get median hh income for SF-Oakland-Hayward MSA as baseline for breaks
# returns 92714 - retain in case API is down
hhinc_metro <- get_acs(
  geography = "metropolitan statistical area/micropolitan statistical area",
  variables = c("hhinc" = "B19013_001"),
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2017
) %>% 
  filter(GEOID == "41860") %>% 
  select(estimate) %>% 
  pull()

# get values for lower & upper "Pew breaks"
hhinc_lower <- ((2/3) * hhinc_metro)
hhinc_upper <- (2 * hhinc_metro)

# binned palette using Pew breaks & full-color univariate scale hex values
pal_hhinc <- colorBin(
  palette = c("#EDEDED", "#FF94C0", "#FF2C54"),
  domain = alameda$hhinc,
  bins = c(0, hhinc_lower, hhinc_upper, max(alameda$hhinc, na.rm = T))
)

# get median personal earnings for metro
# returns 46477
pearn_metro <- get_acs(
  geography = "metropolitan statistical area/micropolitan statistical area",
  variables = c("pearn" = "B20002_001"),
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2017
) %>% 
  filter(GEOID == "41860") %>% 
  select(estimate) %>% 
  pull()

# personal earnings Pew breaks
pearn_lower <- ((2/3) * pearn_metro)
pearn_upper <- (2 * pearn_metro)

# palette using same colors as hh income
pal_pearn <- colorBin(
  palette = c("#EDEDED", "#FF94C0", "#FF2C54"),
  domain = alameda$pearn,
  bins = c(0, pearn_lower, pearn_upper,  max(alameda$pearn, na.rm = T))
)
```


For the Gini coefficient palette, we'll use `colorQuantile()` instead of `colorBin()` and define the breaks at terciles (1/3-quantiles), just as in Grossenbacher's post. Here, we'll get the color hex values from the _blue_ univariate scale.

```{r gini palette, eval=FALSE}
# gini scale, using breaks at terciles (1/3-quantiles)
pal_gini <- colorQuantile(
  palette = c("#EDEDED", "#94C6E7", "#4CB1DF"),
  domain = alameda$gini,
  probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 4)
)
```






## Basic Leaflet Plot

We can now use these palettes to make our basic bivariate choropleth, making sure to fill each region at 50% opacity. We'll want to use a basemap that uses white as a base color to get the same values as our template, so we'll use the Stamen.TonerLite provider tiles (Stamen.Toner is also a good option, but I don't like the black water bodies). If using a different set of provider tiles, we'd want to add square with the basic land color underneath the 50% opacity portion of our Illustrator/Inkscape template so we would know how the blending will turn out.

One note: following [this advice from Joe Chen](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/issues/430#issuecomment-304429145), we need to add the `onRender()` code at the end of the pipeline so that whichever income layer we select (red scale) will always be below the Gini coefficient layer (blue scale). Otherwise the blending would get messed up as the red income scales move above the blue Gini scales when switching income measures. 

```{r basic plot}
m <- alameda %>% 
  leaflet(
    width = "100%",
    options = leafletOptions(zoomSnap = 0.25, zoomDelta = 0.5)
  ) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Stamen.TonerLite") %>% 
  # HH Income Layer
  addPolygons(
    group = "Household Income",
    fillColor = ~pal_hhinc(hhinc),
    fillOpacity = 0.5,
    stroke = FALSE,
    smoothFactor = 0
  ) %>% 
  # Personal Earnings Layer
  addPolygons(
    group = "Personal Earnings",
    fillColor = ~pal_pearn(pearn),
    fillOpacity = 0.5,
    stroke = FALSE,
    smoothFactor = 0
  ) %>% 
  # Gini Layer
  addPolygons(
    group = "Gini Coefficient",
    fillColor = ~pal_gini(gini),
    fillOpacity = 0.5,
    stroke = FALSE,
    smoothFactor = 0
  ) %>% 
  # income measure switching
  addLayersControl(
    baseGroups = c("Household Income", "Personal Earnings"),
    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = FALSE),
    position = "topright"
  ) %>% 
  # forces income measure layer to bottom on switch
  htmlwidgets::onRender("
    function(el, x) {
      this.on('baselayerchange', function(e) {
        e.layer.bringToBack();
      })
    }
  ")

m
```

## Mouseover Labels & UI Enhancements

While a good start, we can improve the usability & readability of our basic map with a few additional features. First, we'll add mouseover labels that display the Houshold Income, Personal Income, and Gini Coefficient of each region for the viewer's reference. We'll also add a 1-pixel stroke to each tract boundary so that we can differentiate between adjacent tracts with the same scale value. We'll add tract highlighting by expanding the border to 2-pixels on mouseover. Finally, we'll add a few user interface enhancements from `leaflet.extras`: a fullscreen button, a button to reset to the original zoom and center, and a slight control delay to prevent accidental zooming while scrolling (overriding the default fade and "click or hover to wake" behavior).


### Generate Labels

Unlike Leaflet's popups functionality, _labels_ don't accept HTML by default, so we need to do a little massaging to get a multiline tooltip-style label. Popups are certainly an alternative option, but I perfer the more automatic-feeling mouseover behavior of a label to the click-open-and-close behavior of a popup, especially when looking at small geographies like census tracts. The method to get a multiline Leaflet label can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43144596/r-and-leaflet-how-to-arrange-label-text-across-multiple-lines). The geographic data in our main data frame messes with the function, so we need to drop the geometry column first.

```{r labels, eval=FALSE}
# data frame with no geographic data
nogeog <- st_drop_geometry(alameda)

# list of HTML for each observation (census tract)
labs <- lapply(seq(nrow(nogeog)), function(i) {
  paste0(
    "Median Household Income: $", 
    prettyNum(nogeog[i, "hhinc"], big.mark = ","), "<br>",
    "Median Presonal Earnings: $", 
    prettyNum(nogeog[i, "pearn"], big.mark = ","), "<br>",
    "Gini Coefficient: ", round(nogeog[i, "gini"], 3)
  ) 
})
```


### Add Enchancements to Map

Now we can add the labels, outlines, and outline highlting to our basic map with a new polygon layer. We'll also tack on the `leaflet.extras` UI enchancements to the end of the pipeline.

```{r add labels etc.}
m %<>% 
  addPolygons(
    label = lapply(labs, htmltools::HTML),
    labelOptions = labelOptions(textsize = "12px"),
    fillColor = NA,
    fillOpacity = 0,
    color = "black",
    weight = 1,
    opacity = 1,
    highlightOptions = highlightOptions(weight = 2)
  ) %>% 
  addResetMapButton() %>% 
  addFullscreenControl() %>% 
  suspendScroll(sleepNote = F, sleepOpacity = 1)

m
```
<p class = "leaflet-caption">Source: American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 2017</p>





## Legend

Our functionality is now in pretty good shape, but we absolutely need a legend. Leaflet's built-in legends can't handle a bivariate color scale, so we'll build our own with `ggplot2` and add it to the Leaflet pipeline as a pseudo-control via `addControl()`.

We'll build our legend following Grossenbacher's methods with a few alterations. To match the values we see on the map, we need to eyedropper the 50% opacity hex values from our template. We'll give each value basic Cartestian coordinates, where x = income bin and y = inequality bin. We'll then create our legend using `geom_tile()`, making sure to use a transparent background in the ggplot theme for reasons we'll get to shortly. Finally, we'll want to save the legend as either SVG or PNG to support transparency.

```{r legend, eval=FALSE}
# data.frame of color values from 50% opacity region in template
legend_scale <- data.frame(
  income = c(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 3), rep(3, 3)),
  inequality = c(rep(seq(1, 3, 1), 3)),
  color = c("#F1F1F1", "#C3DEEE", "#A1D3EA",
            "#F7DBE7", "#CAC8E3", "#A6BDDF",
            "#F7C1CB", "#CAAEC8", "#A6A3C4")
)

# legend
legend <- ggplot() + 
  geom_tile(
    data = legend_scale,
    aes(x = income, y = inequality, fill = color)
  ) + 
  scale_fill_identity() +
  labs(x = "Income →",
       y = "Inequality →") +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA)
  )

# save SVG legend
ggsave("alameda_income_legend.svg", plot = legend,
       width = 3, height = 3, bg = "transparent")
```


We'll want our legend style to match the existing controls for layer switching, zoom, fullscreen, etc. For that, we'll need to replicate and slightly tweek those controls' CSS classes. Depending on a site's specific styling, these may need some additional tweaking, but adding these classes to your CSS should be a good start.

``` 
.legend-bivar {
  padding: 2px;
  font: 10px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  background: white;
  box-shadow: none;
  border: black;
  border: 2px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.2);
  border-radius: 5px;
  background-clip: padding-box;
}

.legend-bivar img{
  margin: 0;
}
```

We can now add our saved legend image with `addControl()`, applying the above CSS with the `className` argument. 

```{r add legend}
m %<>%
  addControl(
    "<img src = 'https://davidelambert.com/img/alameda_income_legend.svg' width = '128' height = '128'>",
    position = "topright",
    className = "legend-bivar"
  )

m
```

And there we have it! An interactive bivariate choropleth with custom legend.
